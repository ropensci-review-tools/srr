`srr` stands for **S**oftware **R**eview **R**oclets, and is an R package
containing roclets for general use in helping those developing and reviewing
packages submitted to rOpenSci. At present, the `srr` package only contains
roclets and associated functions to help those developing and reviewing
packages submitted to rOpenSci's system for [Statistical Software
Review](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/statistical-software-review-book/index.html).
This vignette demonstrates how developers are intended to use this package to
document the alignment of their software with rOpenSci's [standards for
statistical
software](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/statistical-software-review-book/standards.html).

The main functions of the package are constructed as [`roxygen2`
"roclets"](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org), meaning that these functions are called
each time package documentation is updated by calling
[`devtools::document()`](https://devtools.r-lib.org/reference/document.html) or
equivalently
[`roxygen2::roxygenise()`](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/reference/roxygenize.html).
The former is just a wrapper around the latter, to enable documentation to
updated by a single call from within the [`devtools`
package](https://devtools.r-lib.org). From here on, this stage of updating
documentation and triggering the `srr` roclets will be referred to as "running
[`roxygenise`](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/reference/roxygenize.html)."



## 1. The package skeleton

The [`srr_stats_pkg_skeleton()`
function](https://docs.ropensci.org/srr/reference/srr_stats_pkg_skeleton.html)
included with this package differs from
[other](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/utils/html/package.skeleton.html)
[package](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/create_package.html)
[skeleton](https://rdrr.io/cran/Rcpp/man/Rcpp.package.skeleton.html) functions.
Rather than providing a skeleton from which you can construct your own package,
the [`srr_stats_pkg_skeleton()`
function](https://docs.ropensci.org/srr/reference/srr_stats_pkg_skeleton.html)
generates a skeleton to help developers understand this package works. This
skeleton of a package is intended to be modified to help you understand which
kinds of modifications are allowed, and which generate errors. The package is
by default called `"demo"`, is constructed in R's
[`tempdir()`](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/tempfile.html),
and looks like this:

```{r dir-tree}
library (srr)
d <- srr_stats_pkg_skeleton ("package")
fs::dir_tree (d)
```

The files listed there mostly exist to illustrate how standards can be included
within code. The format of standards can be seen by examining any of those
files. For example, the `test.R` file looks like this:
```{r test-file-dummy, eval = FALSE}
readLines (file.path (d, "R", "test.R"))
```
```{r test-file, echo = FALSE}
print (readLines (file.path (d, "R", "test.R")), width = 20)
```

That file illustrates some of the [`roxygen2`](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org) tags
defined by this package, and described in detail below. These tags are parsed
whenever package documentation is updated with
[`roxygenise()`](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/reference/roxygenize.html),
which will produce output like the following:

```{r skeleton-output1-compile, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, results = "hide"}
# need to run once to compile /src so compile output does not appear on 2nd time
pkgbuild::compile_dll (d)
```
```{r skeleton-output-dummy, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
roxygen2::roxygenise (d)
```
```{r skeleton-output, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, message = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
roxygen2::roxygenise (d)
```

The "roclets" contained within this package parse any instances of the
package-specified tags described below, and summarise the output by listing all
locations of each kind of tag. Locations are given as file and line numbers,
and where appropriate, the names of associated functions. We recommend that
developers familiarise themselves with the system by simply modifying any
[`roxygen2`](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org) block in any of the files of this
package skeleton, and running
[`roxygenise()`](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/reference/roxygenize.html)
to see what happens.

## 2. Enabling `srr` roclets for a package

The "roclets" can be enabled for a package by modifying the `DESCRIPTION` file
so that the `Roxygen` line looks like this:

```{r roxygen, eval = FALSE}
Roxygen: list (markdown = TRUE, roclets = c ("namespace", "rd", "srr::srr_stats_roclet"))
```

That will load the ["roclets"](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org) used by this package
to process standards as documented within your actual code. Note that you do
not need to add, import, or depend upon the `srr` package anywhere else within
the `DESCRIPTION` file. See the `DESCRIPTION` file of the package skeleton for
an example.

## 3. `roxygen2` tags

The `srr` packages recognises and uses the following three tags, each of which
may be inserted into [`roxygen2`](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org) documentation
blocks anywhere in your code. The tags are:

1. `@srrstats` tags to indicate standards which have been addressed. These should
   be placed at the locations within your code where specific standards have
   been addressed, and should include a brief textual description of how the
   code at that location addresses the nominated standard.
2. `@srrstatsTODO` tags to indicate standards which have not yet been addressed.
   The [`srr_stats_roxygen()`
   function](https://docs.ropensci.org/srr/reference/srr_stats_roxygen.html)
   described below will place all standards for your nominated categories in an
   initial file in the `/R` directory of your project. Each of these will have
   a tag of `@srrstatsTODO`. As you address each standard, you'll need to move it
   from that initial location to that point in your code where that standard is
   addressed, and change the tag from `@srrstatsTODO` to `@srrstats`. It may help to
   break the initial, commonly very long, single list of standards into smaller
   groups, and to move each of these into the approximate location within your
   code where these are likely to be addressed. For example, all standards
   which pertain to tests can be moved into the `/tests` (or `/tests/testthat`)
   directory.
3. `@srrstatsNA` tags to indicate standards which you deem not applicable to your
   package. These need to be grouped together in a single block with a title of
   `NA_standards`. Such a block is both included in the package skeleton, and
   also in the output of [`srr_stats_roxygen()`
   function](https://docs.ropensci.org/srr/reference/srr_stats_roxygen.html).
   The numbers of any non-applicable standards can then be moved to this block,
   with a note explaining why these standards have been deemed not to apply to
   your package.


The output illustrated above shows how the `srr` package groups these three
tags together, first collecting the output of standards which have been
addressed (via `@srrstats` tags), then showing output of non-applicable standards
(via `@srrstatsNA` tags), and finally standards which are still to be addressed
(via `@srrstatsTODO` tags).

### 3.1 Format of `srr` documentation

The tags shown above from the skeleton package function `test.R` indicates the
expected format of standards within [`roxygen2`](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org)
documentation blocks. The package is designed to error on attempting to run
[`roxygenise()`](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/reference/roxygenize.html) with any
inappropriately formatted entries, and so should provide informative messages
to help rectify any problems. `srr` documentation must adhere to the following
formatting requirements:

1. The tags must appear immediately after the
   [`roxygen2`](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org)-style comment symbols. This will
   almost always mean `#' @srrstats` (but see details below, under *Locations of
   `srrstats` documentation*).
2. The standards number(s) must be enclosed within curly braces, such as 
   `#' @srrstats {G1.0}`. Multiple standards may be associated with a single tag by
   including them within the same single pair of curly braces, and separating
   each by a comma, such as `#' @srrstats {G1.0, G1.1}`.
3. Explanatory text may be placed anywhere before or after curly braces
   enclosing standards, such that `#' @srrstats some text {G1.0}` is entirely
   equivalent to `#' @srrstats {G1.0} some text`.
4. Only the first pair of curly braces is parsed to determine standards
   numbers; any subsequent curly braces within one expression will be ignored.
   (Where an expression is everything that comes after one
   [`roxygen2`](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org) tag, and extends until the start of
   the next tag.) The following will accordingly only refer to G1.0, and not
   G1.1:
    ```{r}
   #' @srrstats {G1.0} as well as {G1.1}.
    ```
    The appropriate way to refer to multiple tags is to include them in the one set of curly braces, as shown above, or to use separate tags, like this:
    ```{r}
    #' @srrstats {G1.0} as well as
    #' @srrstats {G1.1}
    ```
5. Any standard may occur arbitrarily many times in any file(s) within a
   package. The only requirement is that any one standard should only be
   associated with one single kind of tag; thus should only be `@srrstats` (a
   standard which has been addressed), *or* `@srrstatsNA` (a standard which is not
   applicable), *or* `@srrstatsTODO` (a standard which has not yet been addressed).

In almost all cases, all tags for a package will be generated by the initial
call to
[`srr_stats_roxygen()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/srr/reference/srr_stats_roxygen.html),
and should simply be moved to appropriate locations within a package's code
without modifying the format.

### 3.2 Locations of `srrstats` documentation

`@srrstats` tags and accompanying text can be placed almost anywhere within a
package, especially in any file in the main `/R`, `/tests`, or `src/`
directories. Within the `/R` directory, tags should be placed only in
[`roxygen2`](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org) blocks. These tags, and all associated
text, will be ignored by the roclets used by
[`roxygen2`](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org) to generate package documentation, and
will only appear on screen output like that shown above, and generated when
running [`roxygenise()`](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/reference/roxygenize.html).
If tags need to be inserted where there is no
[`roxygen2`](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/reference/roxygenize.html) block, then
a new block will need to be created, the minimal requirement for which is that
it then have an additional `#' @noRd` tag to suppress generation of
documentation (`.Rd`) files. If that block is associated with a function, the
following two lines will suffice:

```{r doc-ex-with-fn}
#' @srrstats G1.0 This standard belongs here
#' @noRd
myfunction <- function (...) {
    # ...
}
```
If that block is not associated with a function, the documentation can be
followed by a `NULL`, like this:
```{r doc-ex-with-null, eval = FALSE}
#' @srrstats G1.0 This standard belongs here
#' @noRd
NULL
```
Unlike [`roxygen2`](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org), which only processes blocks
from within the main `R/` directory, the `srr` package process blocks from
within other directories too. As these blocks will never be passed through to
the main [`roxygenise()`](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/reference/roxygenize.html)
function, they need neither `#' @noRd` tags, nor `NULL` definitions where none
otherwise exist. An example is in the `tests/` directory of the package
skeleton:
```{r tests-ex-dummy, eval = FALSE}
readLines (file.path (d, "tests", "testthat", "test-a.R"))
```
```{r tests-ex, echo = FALSE}
print (readLines (file.path (d, "tests", "testthat", "test-a.R")),
       width = 20)
```

While `@srrstats` tags can also be placed in the `src/` directory, the package
currently only parses [`doxygen`](https://github.com/doxygen/doxygen)-style
blocks for code written in C or C++. (Note that `srr` is currently further
restricted to C++ code compiled with
[`Rcpp`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=Rcpp), but will soon be adapted to
work with other C++ interfaces such as [`cpp11`](https://cpp11.r-lib.org).)
These blocks are converted by 
[`Rcpp`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=Rcpp) into 
[`roxygen2`](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org) blocks in a file called
`R/RcppExports.R`, and so need to include an additional `@noRd` tag to
(optionally) suppress generation of `.Rd` documentation. The skeleton package
again gives an example:
```{r src-ex-dummy, eval = FALSE}
readLines (file.path (d, "src", "cpptest.cpp"))
```
```{r src-ex, echo = FALSE}
print (readLines (file.path (d, "src", "cpptest.cpp")), width = 20)
```

### 3.3 Documenting standards for documentation

Many standards refer to general package documentation, particularly in a
`README` document, or in package vignettes. All such documents are presumed to
be written in `.Rmd` format, for which `@srrstats` tags must be included within
distinct code chunks. Again, the skeleton package has an example as follows:
```{r readme-ex}
readLines (file.path (d, "README.Rmd"))
```

Those lines illustrate the expected form. `@srrstats` tags should be within
a single block contained within a dedicated code chunk. `@srrstats` chunks within
`.Rmd` files will generally use `echo = FALSE` to prevent them appearing in the
rendered documents. The [`roxygen2`](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org) lines do not
need to be followed by a `NULL` (or any other non-
[`roxygen2`](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org) statement), although if additional
R code is necessary for any reason, you may also need to add `eval = FALSE`.

### 3.4 `@srrstatsNA` tags for non-applicable standards

While `@srrstatsTODO` and `@srrstats` tags may be placed anywhere within a package,
`@srrstatsNA` tags used to denote non-applicable standards must be placed within
a dedicated [`roxygen2`](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org) block with a title of
`NA_standards`. As described above, both the package skeleton and the file
produced by calling
[`srr_stats_roxygen()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/srr/reference/srr_stats_roxygen.html)
include templates for this block. The following illustrates a minimal form:

```{r na-block, eval = FALSE}
#' NA_standards
#'
#' @srrstatsNA {S3.3} is not applicable
#' @noRd
NULL
```

An `NA_standards` block must end with `NULL`, rather than be associated with
a function definition. There can be multiple `NA_standards` blocks in any
location, enabling these standards to be moved to approximate locations where
they might otherwise have been addressed. (For example, non-applicable
standards referring to tests might all be grouped together in a single
`NA_standards` block in the `tests/` directory.)

## 4. The `srr` workflow

The first step for any developer intending to use this package on the way to
a submission to rOpenSci's project for peer-reviewing statistical software is
to generate the package skeleton described above, and to try any and all
conceivable ways to modify locations, formats, and other properties of the
[`roxygen2`](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org) tags defined in this package, in order
to understand how these tags are used to generate the summary results when
running [`roxygenise`](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/reference/roxygenize.html).
Following that initial familiarisation, a typical workflow will involve the
following general steps:

1. Automatically download and insert lists of general and category-specific
   standards in your package by running
   [`srr_stats_roxygen()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/srr/reference/srr_stats_roxygen.html)
   (in the main package directory). This will by default generate a file in the
   `R/` directory called `srr-stats-standards.R`, although any alternative name
   can also be passed to the function (or the file can be renamed after it has
   initially been created).
2. Change your package's `DESCRIPTION` file to use the `srr` roclets by adding
   `roclets = "srr::srr_stats_roclet"`) to the `Roxygen` line, as demonstrated at
   the outset, as well as in the package skeleton.
3. Run [`roxygenise`](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/reference/roxygenize.html) to
   confirm that the roclets work on your package. You should initially see only
   a single list of `@srrstatsTODO` standards.
4. We recommend as a first step cutting-and-pasting standards to approximate
   locations within your package's code where you anticipate these standards
   being addressed. Multiple copies of any one standard may exist in multiple
   locations, so you may also repeat standards which you anticipate will be
   addressed in multiple locations. This should reduce a potentially very long
   initial list of standards down to several distinct groups of hopefully more
   manageable size.
5. Begin addressing the standards by:
    - Ensuring your code conforms;
    - Moving each standard to the one or more location(s) where you think your
      code most directly addresses them; 
    - Modifying the `@srrstatsTODO` tag to `@srrstats`
    - Changing the initial text describing the standard itself to a brief
      description of how your code addresses that standard.
6. Standards which you deem not to be applicable to your package should be
   grouped together in a single [`roxygen2`](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org) block
   with the title `NA_standards` (as described above, and as generated by the
   [`srr_stats_roxygen()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/srr/reference/srr_stats_roxygen.html)
   function).
7. Update your documentation as frequently as you like or need, and use the
   output of the roclets to inform and guide the process of converting all
   `@srrstatsTODO` tags into either `@srrstats` or `@srrstatsNA` tags.

Note that we do **not** recommend copying files from the package skeleton into
your own package for you `srr` documentation. The following lines demonstrate
what happens if you insert actual standards into the package skeleton:

```{r dl-stds-fakey, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
srr_stats_roxygen (category = "regression", # for example
                   filename = file.path (d, "R", "srr-stats-standards.R"),
                   overwrite = TRUE)
```
```{r dl-stds, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
srr_stats_roxygen (category = "regression", # for example
                   filename = file.path (d, "R", "srr-stats-standards.R"),
                   overwrite = TRUE)
```
```{r mixed-tags-fakey, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
roxygen2::roxygenise (d)
```
```{r mixed-tags, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, error = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
roxygen2::roxygenise (d)
```
To ensure all standards are first inserted with `@srrstatsTODO` tags, and that
there are no duplicates with other tags, please use only the
[`srr_stats_roxygen()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/srr/reference/srr_stats_roxygen.html)
function.
